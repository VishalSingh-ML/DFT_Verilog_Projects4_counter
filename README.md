## 🔧 Description

- `counter.v` contains Verilog HDL code for a 4-bit synchronous binary counter with active-low reset.
- The project was synthesized and compiled using Quartus Prime Lite (Cyclone IV E device family).
- Output RTL schematic and compiled result were captured from Quartus Prime and added here.
